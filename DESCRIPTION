Description: Tools for generating and estimating matrix-variate Normal (MVN) and 
    matrix-variate Skew-Normal (MVSN) models with or without interval censoring 
    and missing data. The package includes functions to simulate uncensored and 
    censored matrix-valued observations from MVN and MVSN distributions. 
    Estimation routines cover maximum likelihood estimation for complete MVN 
    data, EM algorithms for complete MVSN data, and ECM-type procedures for 
    MVN and MVSN models under interval censoring and missingness. Core 
    functionality includes generation of matrix-variate samples based on the 
    skew-normal representation X = M + A|Z| + V, simulation of censored MVN and 
    MVSN observations, likelihood evaluation, and EM/ECM inference methods that 
    jointly account for skewness, censoring, and incomplete data in 
    matrix-valued settings.
